# Configuration for rPath repeater endpoints
#
# Note: When setting the following configuration parameters, be sure to
# take the following into account:
# 
# o The endpoints should be generally be configured in a hub and spoke 
#   method.  Where the hub includes the last mile repeater to the
#   rBuilder.  The spokes are typically going to be the rPath Update
#   servers
#
# o The way in which the rBuilder has been configured to handle the
#   activation and polling of systems
#
# For more details, see the rBuilder Administration Guide.
